- Allow a user to create tasks - every project is associated with a Project or a Task Category which may never complete (for example - Admin Work)
- Projects and tasks should be managed from a single home page. 
- All projects are displayed on the home page with only up to the next three tasks shown for each project.

- The solution can be deployed as a container.
- The solution should be a single build - it should not require separate front end compilation.
- The solution should be as efficient as possible in terms of memory and CPU.
